Mintlayer runs a responsible disclosure program for security issues, as such all security issues should be reported to enrico@mintlayer.org. When reporting, please encrypt your report using Enrico's GPG key, which can be found [here](https://www.mintlayer.org/assets/keys/enrico).

If you disclose a valid security issue, you may be eligible for a bounty paid in ML, see the details [here](https://www.mintlayer.org/bug-bounty-program).

It's best to err on the side of caution, so if you find something you think is security related but not eligible for the bounty or something you're not 100% sure about then let us know on the above email address anyway as we treat each report on a report by report basis so you may still be paid a bounty.

Security issues may not be publicly announced until Mintlayer agrees.
