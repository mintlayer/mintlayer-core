Mintlayer runs a responsible disclosure program for security issues, as such all security issues should be reported to security@mintlayer.org or ben@mintlayer.org.
If you disclose a valid security issue then you may be eligible for a bounty paid in ML see the details [here](https://www.mintlayer.org/bug-bounties/).

It's best to err on the side of caution, if you find something you think is security related but not eligible for the bounty or something you're not 100% sure about then let us know on the above email addresses anyway as we treat each report on a report by report basis so you may still be paid a bounty.

GPG keys for Ben and Sam can be found [here for Ben](https://www.mintlayer.org/assets/keys/ben) and [here for Sam](https://www.mintlayer.org/assets/keys/samer).

Security issues may not be publicly announced until Mintlayer agrees.
