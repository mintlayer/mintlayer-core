# crate, which is indirectly used by `trezor-client`. The license itself is fine, but for some reason
# `cargo deny` doesn't complain about it even though it's not in the list (but note that it does complain
# about it in the `bridge_v2` repo, which inherits `hex_lit` from `mintlayer-core`).
# Need to investigate why it happens.
