/// An asymptote that with its limit to infinity, reaches the value one.
/// The function is normalized so that the limit as t goes to infinity is one.
///
/// Creation:
/// This function is created by integrating the function `alpha * exp(-alpha * x) dx` from 0 to t.
/// The parameter alpha controls the steepness of the curve; i.e., how fast the function converges.
///
/// Benefits:
/// This function is to be used to compute the accumulated trust of a chain for chain selection.
/// Having an asymptotic function that tends to one means that no matter how many empty time-slots
/// are in the chain, the weight will always be less than one, which is the weight of a single block.
/// This function can be used to programmatically prefer chains that have denser blocks in time.
