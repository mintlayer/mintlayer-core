crypto provides the basic crypto primitives required for mintlayer

if you have any questions about the crypto subsystem speak to ben
do not use crypto primitives without understanding what you are doing - speak to amin, ben and sam for clarification

hashing
- blake2
- sha1  !!! DO NOT USE UNLESS YOU KNOW WHAT YOU ARE DOING
- sha2
- sha3 
- ripemd160

example of use from another subsystem
add your dependencies to your cargo.toml file


```
crypto = {path = "../crypto"}

```

then you can use it like such

```
use crypto::hash::hash;
use crypto::Blake2b;
let mut buf_blake2 = Vec::new();
hash::<Blake2b>((b"a").to_vec(), &mut buf_blake2); //your result is now stored in buf_blake2b

```

see the tests in hash.rs for more examples of usage.
