//! Definitions used to implement storage backends
//!
//! # High-level overview
//!
//! A database can be thought of as a collection of key-value maps.
//!
//! ```notest
//! Map<DbMapId, Map<Key, Value>>
//! ```
//!
//! [DbMapId] is used to identify a particular key-value map. `Key` and `Value` are raw byte
//! sequences ([Data]). To access a particular value, the database needs to be indexed first by a
//! [DbMapId] (to get the key-value map) and then by a key.
//!
//! The inner key-value map is often referred to as DB map or even just map. The set of DB maps is
//! fixed for the duration of backend lifetime but their contents may change.
//!
//! ## Database description
//!
//! The backend is given access to a collection of metadata describing the database structure in
//! an instance of [DbDesc]. Most importantly, it communicates the number of DB maps and contains
//! information about the individual maps in [DbMapDesc], most notably the name.
//!
//! # Backend implementation guidelines
//!
//! Implementing a storage backend involves defining a couple of traits satisfying a number of
//! traits defined in [crate::backend].
//!
//! ## Initialization
//!
//! The main entry point is a type implementing the [Backend] trait. This type is used to identify
//! the backend. The object of this type contains information used to initialize the backend such
//! as database path and various settings.
//!
//! Database is started by calling [Backend::open] which uses the backend-specific information
//! together with database description to initialize the database. That involves opening the
//! database and, if necessary, setting up backend-specific representation of DB maps. The
//! [types::DbMapsData::transform] method can be used to transform backend-agnostic information
//! about DB maps into backend-specific handle to the DB maps.
//!
//! The result of opening a backend is something of type [Backend::Impl] that implements the
//! [backend::BackendImpl] trait. It represents an initialized and running database.
//!
//! ## Transactions
//!
//! Currently, all data accesses in backend happen through transactions. This restriction may be
//! lifted in the future, allowing primitive operations to be performed without a transaction for
//! performance reasons.
//!
//! Starting read-only and read-write transactions is defined by implementing the
//! [backend::TransactionalRo] and [backend::TransactionalRw] traits on [Backend::Impl].
//!
//! Committing a read-write transaction is defined by implementing [backend::TxRw]. A read-only
//! transaction type has to be marked with the [backend::TxRo] trait.
//!
//! Rolling back read-write transaction and closing read-only transaction is defined by dropping
//! the corresponding transaction object. If any special processing is required, [Drop] has to be
//! implemented.
//!
//! ## Implementing operations
//!
//! Individual database operations are defined by implementing the following traits:
//!
//! * [backend::ReadOps]
//! * [backend::WriteOps]
//!
//! ## Adaptor pattern
//!
//! Sometimes, it is useful to create a database backend that wraps another backend and adds
//! functionality. Use cases include but are not limited to logging and caching.
