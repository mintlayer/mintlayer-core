## Module `blockprod`

### Method `blockprod_stop_all`

to all currently running jobs to stop running to stop block production.


Parameters:
```
{}
```

Returns:
```
number
```

### Method `blockprod_stop_job`

When called, the job manager will be notified to send a signal
to the specified job to stop running.


Parameters:
```
{ "job_id": hex string }
```

Returns:
```
bool
```

### Method `blockprod_generate_block`

Generate a block with the given transactions.

Parameters:
- `input_data`: The input data for block generation, such as staking key.
- `transactions`: The transactions prioritized to be included in the block.
                  Notice that it's the responsibility of the caller to ensure that the transactions are valid.
                  If the transactions are not valid, the block will be rejected and will not be included in the blockchain.
                  It's preferable to use `transaction_ids` instead, where the mempool will ensure that the transactions are valid
                  against the current state of the blockchain.
- `transaction_ids`: The transaction IDs of the transactions to be included in the block from the mempool.
- `packing_strategy`: Whether or not to include transactions from the mempool in the block, other than the ones specified in `transaction_ids`.


Parameters:
```
{
    "input_data": hex string,
    "transactions": [ hex string, .. ],
    "transaction_ids": [ hex string, .. ],
    "packing_strategy": EITHER OF
         1) "FillSpaceFromMempool"
         2) "LeaveEmptySpace",
}
```

Returns:
```
hex string
```

### Method `blockprod_e2e_public_key`

Get the public key to be used for end-to-end encryption.


Parameters:
```
{}
```

Returns:
```
hex string
```

### Method `blockprod_generate_block_e2e`

Same as `generate_block`, but with end-to-end encryption.

The end-to-end encryption helps in protecting the signing key, so that it is much harder
for an eavesdropper to get it with pure http/websocket connection.
The e2e_public_key is the pubic key for end-to-end encryption of the client.


Parameters:
```
{
    "encrypted_input_data": [ number, .. ],
    "e2e_public_key": hex string,
    "transactions": [ hex string, .. ],
    "transaction_ids": [ hex string, .. ],
    "packing_strategy": EITHER OF
         1) "FillSpaceFromMempool"
         2) "LeaveEmptySpace",
}
```

Returns:
```
hex string
```

### Method `blockprod_collect_timestamp_search_data_e2e`

Collect the search data needed by the `timestamp_searcher` module.

See `timestamp_searcher::collect_timestamp_search_data` for the details about
the parameters.


Parameters:
```
{
    "pool_id": hex string,
    "min_height": number,
    "max_height": EITHER OF
         1) number
         2) null,
    "seconds_to_check_for_height": number,
    "all_timestamps_between_blocks": bool,
}
```

Returns:
```
hex string
```
