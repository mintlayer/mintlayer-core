## Helper scripts to produce a target and a timestamp difference plots.

First run `collect_data.py` to collect the data from a chainstate db.

Then run `show_plots.py` to show the plots. By default, the script will plot the entire set of
data; use the `--recent-days` parameter to only plot the data from the last few days.
