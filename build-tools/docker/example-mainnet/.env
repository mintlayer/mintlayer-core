# IMPORTANT: changing this port alone won't be enough to make your node discoverable by other nodes
# (or, if it was already discoverable, it may make it not discoverable anymore).
# The reason is that the node will advertise itself to the peers as "your_global_ip_address:the_port_you_specify_here".
# So, if you are behind NAT, you have to also make sure that "the_port_you_specify_here" is open to
# the outside world and mapped to "the_port_you_specify_here" on your host machine.
# On the other hand if you don't care about incoming connections from other nodes, just leave
# this variable as is.
