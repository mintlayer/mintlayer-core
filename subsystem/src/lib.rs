//! General framework for working with subsystems
//!
//! The [Manager] type handles a collection of subsystems. The framework also takes care of
//! inter-subsystem calls and clean shutdown. Subsystems communicate using [Handle]s.
//!
//! ## Calls
//!
//! Calls are dispatched by sending a closure over a channel to the subsystem. The subsystem then
//! sends the result back using a oneshot channel. The channel is awaited to emulate synchronous
//! calls.
//!
//! ## Shutdown sequence
//!
//! The shutdown proceeds in three phases:
//!
//! 1. As soon as any subsystem terminates, the main task is notified.
//! 2. The main task broadcasts the shutdown request to all subsystems. The subsystems react to the
//!    request by shutting themselves down.
//! 3. The main task waits for all subsystems to terminate.
